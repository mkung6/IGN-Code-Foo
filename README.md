### 02-pokeballs

Team Rocket is at it again! This time they are looking to terrorize the city of San Francisco, and aim to make the trek through the “crookedest street in the world” ( Lombard Street ) to steal a treasure contained in Coit Tower. Legend has it, the tower is completely filled with Poké Balls, enough Poké Balls for Team Rocket to amass an army of Pokémon! Fortunately, a slumbering Pokémon is known to sleep at the bottom of Lombard St and block the entrance to Coit Tower entirely. If Team Rocket determines how to wake the sleeping giant and successfully steals the cache of Poké Balls that fills Coit Tower, about how many Poké Balls would they walk away with? Describe each step in your thought process.

### 03-witcher

After a hard fought battle with a particularly tough Werewolf, renowned Witcher Geralt of Rivia is in need of some new armor. Fortunately, there was a bounty for the recently defeated beast, and for his triumph Geralt has received a good bit of coin ( called Crowns ). Traveling to a nearby armorer, Geralt is faced with more options than he is used to. Given his funds, the Witcher needs to purchase an armor set with the highest possible total armor value.

Create a program that will determine the armor set of the highest value based on Geralt’s available currency ( Crowns ). An armor set requires one piece of armor of each type (Chest, Leggings, Helmet, Boots) as well as an extra piece that can be of any type.

* 300 Crowns Available
* You must be able to afford the total price of your armor set given your available Crowns
* Each piece of armor contains a type, name, price, and armor value
* Remember, an armor set requires one piece of armor of each type (Chest, Leggings, Helmet, Boots) as well as an extra piece that can be of any type
* Inventory in Armorer’s shop [provided](https://s3.amazonaws.com/o.www.ign.com/code-foo/2019/static/Witcher+Inventory+(1).pdf)
* Display the final answer.
* Explain how you implemented the solution. Is your solution successful with other inventories?

### 04-full-stack

Create a chat application. The app should allow at least 2 users to chat in real time over a network connection. Give consideration to how information is stored, updated, and displayed. Data should be persistent. Add any useful features or web design practices you think would make it your own. The application does not need to scale to more than 2 users.
